üèè About the IPL Match Prediction Project

üîç Project Overview
This project aims to predict outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning models and enrich those predictions with reasoning using a local large language model (LLM). The system is built with both FastAPI and Django, demonstrating how statistical learning can be fused with modern web technologies and LLM-based explainability to deliver intelligent sports analytics.

üì¶ Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Data Collection
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:  
üîó https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajusaipainkra/tata-ipl-2025-datasets

It included:
- matches.csv for match-level details
- deliveries.csv for ball-by-ball analysis

2. Feature Engineering
I performed extensive feature engineering to convert raw cricket data into useful inputs for machine learning models. This included:
- Team averages and recent form over the last 5 matches
- Player-level metrics like strike rate, bowling economy, wickets, etc.
- Venue-based features like home advantage
- Toss outcomes and momentum (win/loss streaks)
- Time-series components for trends

Pipelines were implemented using scikit-learn's Pipeline class for reproducibility.

3. Model Development
I implemented an ensemble-based architecture using:
- XGBoost
- Random Forest

The models were trained using both default and tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance. GridSearchCV and custom feature control mechanisms were used for hyperparameter tuning and training.

4. API Development
After finalizing the model:
- I built a FastAPI backend with endpoints for match predictions, player performance forecasts, and confidence intervals.
- This API layer was then consumed in a Django frontend, which serves as the primary user interface for predictions.

5. LLM Integration for Reasoning
To make the predictions more interpretable and insightful:
- I integrated Gemini LLM (via a local or cloud setup).
- The LLM provides contextual reasoning behind each prediction, like "Why a team is more likely to win", based on recent performance, player form, and venue dynamics.
- Prompt engineering was used to ensure high-quality, informative explanations from the LLM.

6. UI/UX Improvements
The final stage focused on refining the user experience:
- I built clean, responsive dashboards in Django.
- The UI displays predicted outcomes, player stats, trend charts, and LLM reasoning explanations.
- Emphasis was placed on user interaction and accessibility to insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Web APIs: FastAPI (REST endpoints), Django (frontend)
- LLM Integration: Gemini LLM (local/cloud)
- Dev Tools: Git, VS Code, Postman

üìà Outcome
By combining machine learning, LLM reasoning, and interactive web development, this project offers a full-stack solution for IPL analytics‚Äîdelivering not just predictions but explainable, data-backed insights for cricket fans and analysts alike.
